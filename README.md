# Weather Dashboard
We are creating an application, that will help the user with planning a trip by being able to look up current and future city conditions. 

It will be a very user friendly website, when searching a city it will provide the city name, current date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and a colored icon representation of weather conditions from favorable, moderate, or severe.

The cities previously searched will be populated on the left hand side of the page creating a search history list. Newer searches will keep stacking on top of the list, the user can click on any of the previously searched cities to access the weather information again.
