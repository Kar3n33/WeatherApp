# Weather Dashboard
We are creating an application, that will help the user with planning a trip by being able to look up current and future city conditions. 

It will be a very user friendly website, when searching a city it will provide the city name, current date, temperature, humidity, wind speed, UV index and a colored icon representation of weather conditions from favorable, moderate, or severe.

The cities previously searched will be saved on the search history, this way the user can click on any of the searched city forecasts to access that information again.
